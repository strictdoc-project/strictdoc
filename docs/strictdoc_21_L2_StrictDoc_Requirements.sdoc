TITLE: Data model
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc shall be based on a data model.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
Designing StrictDoc with a goal of having a consistent data model ensures that the tool:

1) can support a rich set of use cases,
2) model the existing documentation templates used by the industries,
3) interface well with other formats for storing documentation and requirements, e.g., ReqIF and SPDX.

StrictDoc's data model shall support a concept of a "Section" which nests other Sections, Requirements, Texts.

"Section" corresponds to a chapter or a section in a document and helps to organize a document by grouping text nodes, requirements and other sections.

TITLE: Free text
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc's data model shall support a "Free Text" model, representing non-normative documentation content.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
Documentation comprises normative components, such as uniquely identifiable elements like requirements or design items, and non-normative components, including introductory text, overview chapters, and other content. The non-normative parts help provide a general understanding for the reader but do not contribute to traceability information. StrictDoc's free text is designed to store this type of non-normative information in SDoc documents.

TITLE: Composeable document
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc's data model shall allow composing a Document from other Documents.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The logic behind the parent requirement remains fully relevant. Additionally, an alternative approach could involve using a dedicated entity, like "Fragment", to allow a Document to be composed of includable sections or document fragments. Managing composition at the Document level eliminates the need in additional entities like "Fragment", streamlining both the conceptual understanding and the practical implementation of composability.

STATEMENT: >>>
The StrictDoc data model shall support connecting requirements using Parent and Child relations.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
Support of both Parent and Child relations allows to build typical requirements relations such as child-to-parent and less common relations when one document can have parent links to a parent document and child links to a child document (e.g., the so-called "compliance" or "tailoring matrix" documents may use this structure).

StrictDoc shall support referencing any node by embedding a hyperlink within the text content of another node.
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The inline links do not replace the relations between SDoc nodes. Instead, an inline link could be an easy way to refer from one textual node to a chapter or a document. A common use case is "See section ABC for more details".

STATUS: Active
TITLE: SDoc markup language
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc shall implement its own text markup language called S-Doc (strict-doc).
<<<
RATIONALE: >>>
The most commonly used Markdown format lacks the ability to store requirements metadata. While the RST syntax does allow for customization with directives to implement metadata extensions, its visual appearance contradicts other requirements of StrictDoc, such as the type-safety of the grammar and visual readability. Therefore, a markup language tailored specifically to the needs of the requirements tool provides direct control over the capabilities implemented in both the markup and the user interface.

StrictDoc shall ensure that identical SDoc content is produced every time StrictDoc reads an SDoc file and then writes it to another SDoc file.

A consistent import/export roundtrip implementation and testing reduces the risk of the SDoc bi-directional import/export corruption.

The StrictDoc's graph database shall maintain the requirement relations and their reverse relations as follows:

- For a Parent relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Child relation.
- For a Child relation, the database shall calculate the reverse Parent relation.

The calculation of the reverse relations allows the user interface code to get and display both requirement's parent and child relations.

Example: If a child requirement REQ-002 has a parent requirement REQ-001, the graph database first reads the link ``REQ-002 -Parent> REQ-001``, then it creates a corresponding ``REQ-001 -Child> REQ-002`` on the go. Both relations can be queried as follows, in pseudocode:

    get_parent_requirements(REQ-002) == [REQ-001]
    get_children_requirements(REQ-001) == [REQ-002]
