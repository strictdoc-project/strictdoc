TITLE: Project goals

[TEXT]
MID: bdbd5aecefdc41bca1c88b9bce71d512
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc is an open-source tool for writing technical documentation and requirements management. The long-term goal of the project is to provide a capable, open-source platform for creating and managing technical documentation.

**Requirements automation**

The tool aims to automate the requirements documentation process at various levels.

**Target groups**

The project targets different user groups including those in software, hardware, systems (systems engineering, electrical, thermal), as well as quality assurance, safety, management, and non-technical areas.

**Use on individual computers and cloud**

The project is already usable on individual personal computer, the long-term goal is to enable its use on cloud.

**Open data**

An important feature of StrictDoc is its focus on open data, ensuring ease of data transfer both into and out of the system.

**Synergies with other tools**

StrictDoc shall be compatible with other software and engineering tools. This includes at least the compatibility with the Python ecosystem, the model-based systems engineering tools, such as Capella, and the formats providing Software Bill of Materials, such as SPDX.

STATEMENT: >>>
As an open-source project, StrictDoc is developed without strict deadlines, however there are certain high-level priorities that influence the development. The work is loosely organized in quarters.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 2023-Q3
     - Anchors and incoming links. Improvements of the ReqIF interface. Work on StrictDoc's own requirements traceability. Mermaid diagramming tool. Reverse parent / child links. Project statistics screen. Performance improvements.
   * - 2023-Q4
     - Requirements relations and roles. UI improvements and stabilization. Further ReqIF work. Search engine and requirements filters. Project tree Diff/Changelog screens. Basic Git operations.
   * - 2024-Q1
     - Experimental SPDX support. JSON export. Custom views (static HTML). Basic traceability matrix screen.
   * - 2024-Q2
     - Includable/composable documents. FREETEXT-to-TEXT migration. ReqIF improvements.
   * - 2024-Q3
     - HTML2PDF improvements. ReqIF roundtrip for RELATION/ROLE. Consistent automatic escaping of Jinja templates. Passthrough->export command migration.
   * - 2024-Q4
     - Connecting requirements to functions (C, Python) and classes (Python) in source code. Support the linking in both directions independently: from requirements to source using RELATION/File and from source to requirements using @relation markers. LINK to documents.
   * - 2025-Q1
     - Connecting requirements to source code â€“ further work. StrictDoc containerized in Docker. JUnit XML report generation.
   * - 2025-Q2 (planned)
     - Gcov coverage justification report. SDoc node VERSIONs. External links.

[TEXT]
MID: ee541e7062704b3f919bcaac2bce2723
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc has three groups of tests: unit, integration, end-to-end tests.

The unit tests are based on `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_.

The integration tests are based on the `LLVM Integrated Tester <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html>`_ and `FileCheck.py <https://github.com/mull-project/FileCheck.py/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_. These tools are not very common, refer to `How to test command-line programs with Python tools: LIT and FileCheck <https://stanislaw.github.io/2020-11-20-how-to-test-command-line-programs-with-python.html>`_ for a good description.

The end-to-end web interface tests are based on the `SeleniumBase <https://seleniumbase.io/>`_ test framework.

TITLE: Traceability between StrictDoc requirements, code, and tests

[TEXT]
MID: f829d28d2e3d4bcaa38f44ffb1ac0373
STATEMENT: >>>
Most of StrictDoc's implemented features are tested through its own documentation artifacts. In terms of traceability, StrictDoc maintains a growing number of trace links between:

- Documentation and source files
- Source files and tests
- Tests, test results, and code coverage data

As of Q2 2025, the goal is to achieve 100% traceability across all artifacts in the StrictDoc codebase.

TITLE: Python baseline

[TEXT]
MID: 081ee6266bab4a3a80f290c95e055a25
STATEMENT: >>>
The supported version of Python is kept to be as low as possible. As of 2024-Q4, the currently supported version is Python 3.8.

Ideally, the lowest Python version should only be raised when it is consistently deprecated by the major software platforms like Ubuntu or GitHub Actions.

Another reason for upgrading the minimum Python version is due to the upstream dependencies. As these dependencies stop supporting the older versions of Python, StrictDoc must be upgraded to maintain compatibility. With the existing dependency graph, this happens rather infrequently as most dependencies also maintain the compatibility with the older Python versions.
