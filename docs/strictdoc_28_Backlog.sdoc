[FREETEXT]
This document outlines the future work items for StrictDoc.

The following items are listed in descending order of priority, with the topmost items either currently in progress or scheduled to be implemented next.

While this backlog overlaps with StrictDoc's `GitHub issues tracker <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/issues>`_ by more than 50%, it includes more strategic items compared to the GitHub issues, which are primarily focused on actual implementation work.

- Uploading images via Web interface.

- Deleting sections recursively. Correct clean-up of all traceability information.

- Editing remaining document options: Inline/Table, Requirements in TOC, etc.

- **Integration with Git repository.** Make the server commit changes to .sdoc files automatically. To a user, provide visibility to what happens under the hood.

- ``LINK`` between sections and documents.

- Option to keep all multi-line text fields to 80 symbols width.

- Moving nodes between documents.

- TBL view: Column filters to show/hide columns.

- TBL view: Completely empty columns are hidden by default.

- Contextual help about the RST markup.
- How to edit tables conveniently?

- What to do with web content going out of sync with the server/file system state?

- Issue when adding a child section from a nested section. The child section appears right after the nested section, not after its farthest descendant child.

- ReqIF: Export complete documentation tree or a single document.
- ReqIF: Import complete documentation tree or a single document.

- Configuration file options:

  - CLI command to dump default config file
  - Project prefix?
  - Config options for presenting requirements.
    - Include/exclude requirements in TOC

- **StrictDoc as a Python library**. Such a use allows a more fine-grained access to the StrictDoc's modules, such as Grammar, Import, Export classes, etc.

- **Data exchange with Capella tool.** The current idea would be to implement this using ReqIF export/import features.

- **Language Server Protocol.** The LSP can enable editing of SDoc files in IDEs like Eclipse, Visual Studio, PyCharm. A smart LSP can enable features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion and easy navigation through requirements. The promising base for the implementation: https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls.

- StrictDoc shall support rendering text/code blocks into Markdown syntax.

- **Fuzzy requirements search.** This feature can be implemented in the CLI as well as in the future GUI. A fuzzy requirements search can help to find existing requirements and also identify relevant requirements when creating new requirements.

- Support creation of FMEA/FMECA safety analysis documents.

- Calculation of checksums for requirements. This feature is relatively easy to implement, but the implementation is postponed until the linking between requirements and files is implemented.

- Filtering of requirements by tags.

- Import/export: Excel, CSV, PlantUML, Confluence, Tex, Doorstop.

- **Partial evaluation of Jinja templates.** Many of the template variables could be made to be evaluated once, for example, config object's variables.

- UI version for mobile devices (at least some basic tweaks).

- When a document is added, the whole documentation is rebuilt from the file system from scratch. A more fine-grained re-indexing of documentation tree can be implemented. The current idea is to introduce a layer of pickled cached data: preserve the whole in-memory traceability graph in a cache, and then use the cached data for making decisions about what should be regenerated.
- The "no framework" approach with FastAPI and Turbo/Stimulus allows writing almost zero Javascript, however some proto-framework conventions are still needed. Currently, all code is written in the ``main_controller`` which combines all responsibilities, such as parsing HTTP request fields, accessing traceability graph, validations, rendering back the updated AJAX templates. A lack of abstraction is better than a poor abstraction, but some solution has to be found.
- Request form object vs Response form object. The workflow of form validations is not optimal.
- For Web development, the responsibilities of the ``TraceabilityIndex`` class compared to the ``ExportAction``, ``MarkupRenderer``, ``LinkRenderer`` classes are unstable. A more ecological composition of classes has to be found. ``Traceability`` index is rightfully a "god object" because it contains all information about the in-memory documentation graph.

StrictDoc supports this for HTML already but not for RST.

When passed
``strictdoc export ... /path/to/doctree1, /path/to/doctree2, /path/to/doctree3``,
the following is generated:

.. code-block:: text

    output folder:
    - doctree1/
      - contents
    - doctree2/
      - contents
    - doctree3/
      - contents

and all three doctrees' requirements are merged into a single documentation
space with cross-linking possible.

The question is if it is worth supporting this case further or StrictDoc should
only work with one input folder with a single doc tree.
