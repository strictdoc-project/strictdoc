TITLE: Requirements engineering
STATEMENT: >>>
The Requirements Tool's development process shall include the Requirements Tool's own requirements engineering.

UID: SECTION-RTC-Appendix-A-Document-archetypes
TITLE: Appendix A: Document archetypes

[FREETEXT]
StrictDoc shall support the following document archetypes: **requirements document**
and **specification** document. For both archetypes, StrictDoc shall further
support the following options.

.. list-table:: Table: Requirements and specification document
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * -
     - Requirements document
     - Specification document
   * - Examples
     - Most typical: requirements lists split by categories (e.g., Functional
       Requirements, Interface Requirements, Performance Requirements, etc.)
     - Often: a standard document
   * - Structure
     - Not nested or not too deeply nested
     - Nested
   * - Visual presentation
     - Requirements are often presented as table cells. Cells can be standalone
       or the whole section or document can be a long table with cells.
     - Requirements are rather presented as header + text
   * - Unique requirement identifiers (UID)
     - Most always
     - - Present or not
       - **NOT SUPPORTED YET:** Can be missing, the chapter headers are used instead.
         The combination "Number + Title" becomes a reference-able identifier.
         A possible intermediate solution when modeling such a document is to
         make the UIDs map to the section number.
   * - Requirement titles
     - - Often
       - **NOT SUPPORTED YET:** But maybe absent (ex: NASA cFS SCH). If absent,
         the grouping is provided by sections.
     - Requirement titles are most often section titles
   * - Real-world examples
     - - NASA cFE Functional Requirements
       - MISRA C coding guidelines,
       - NASA Software Engineering Requirements NPR 7150.2
     - - ECSS Software ECSS-E-ST-40C
