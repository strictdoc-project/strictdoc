STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc is software for technical documentation and requirements management.

Summary of StrictDoc features:

- The documentation files are stored as human-readable text files.
- A simple domain-specific language DSL is used for writing the documents. The
  text format for encoding this language is called SDoc (strict-doc).
- StrictDoc reads \*.sdoc files and builds an in-memory representation of a
  document tree.
- From this in-memory representation, StrictDoc can generate the documentation
  into a number of formats including HTML, RST, ReqIF, PDF, JSON, Excel.
- StrictDoc has a web-based user interface which allows viewing and editing the documents and requirements. The changes are written back to .sdoc files.
- The focus of the tool is modeling requirements and specifications documents.
  Such documents consist of multiple statements like "system X shall do Y"
  called requirements.
- The requirements can be linked together to form the relationships, such as
  "parent-child". From these connections, many useful features, such as
  `Requirements Traceability <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_traceability>`_
  and Documentation Coverage, can be derived.
- Requirements to source files traceability (experimental). See
  [LINK: SECTION-TRACEABILITY-REQS-TO-SOURCE-CODE].
- Document grammar and custom fields support. The StrictDoc's grammar can be
  extended to support arbitrary special fields, such as "PRIORITY", "OWNER",
  or even more specialized fields, such as
  "Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL)" or "Verification method".
  See [LINK: SECTION-UG-DOCUMENT-GRAMMAR].
- Good performance of the `textX <https://github.com/textX/textX>`_
  parser and parallelized incremental generation of documents: generation of
  document trees with up to 2000–3000 requirements into HTML pages stays within
  a few seconds. From the second run, only changed documents are regenerated.
  Further performance tuning should be possible.

The StrictDoc team hosts a weekly 1-hour office hours meeting.

StrictDoc Office Hours provide an open space for users and contributors to connect with the core team. Spontaneous participation is highly encouraged – feel free to join at any time with questions, ideas, or feedback. By default, these slots are used for StrictDoc development unless a specific topic is agreed upon in advance.

The goal is to balance core development priorities with community-driven input. While the team follows a focused roadmap, these sessions create space for discussing feature requests, improvements, and other topics that matter most to users – especially active contributors. Agenda updates will be posted in the calendar when applicable.

Here is a `public Google calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9e52bdb79398efa1c138c5938a54d48918b2858a9564f7326477879ec27c34b3%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FBerlin>`_ to subscribe to.

When adding the calendar, it's recommended to enable notifications for new and updated events. This ensures you'll be informed if an event's agenda is updated with announcements or if the event is canceled.

    TITLE: Requirements management
    STATEMENT: StrictDoc shall enable requirements management.

Create a file called ``hello_world.sdoc`` somewhere on your file system and copy the above "Hello World" example text to it. **The file must end with a newline character**.

Open a command-line terminal program supported on your system.

Once you have ``strictdoc`` installed (see [LINK: SDOC_UG_GETTING_STARTED] below), switch to the directory with the ``hello_world.sdoc`` file. For example, assuming that the file is now in the ``workspace/hello_world`` directory in your user folder:

.. code:: text

    cd <your user home directory>/workspace/hello_world

Run StrictDoc as follows:

.. code:: text

    strictdoc export .

The expected output:

.. code:: text

    $ strictdoc export hello.sdoc
    Parallelization: Enabled
    Step 'Collect traceability information' start
    Step 'Find and read SDoc files' start
    Reading SDOC: hello.sdoc .................................... 0.08s

    Export completed. Documentation tree can be found at:
    .../output/html

The HTML output produced so far has been generated statically. Now, start a StrictDoc server from the same directory:

.. code:: text

    strictdoc server .

The expected output should contain the following line:

.. code:: text

[TEXT]
MID: 32e04944c2a14ead93248ff1ea37a68d
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc can be installed with a dedicated Docker image.

To build the image:

.. code:: text

    docker build . \
        --build-arg STRICTDOC_SOURCE=pypi \
        -t strictdoc:latest

The ``STRICTDOC_SOURCE`` argument is optional (default value is ``pypi``) and can be used to specify which Git revision the container shall check out when installing StrictDoc with ``pip install``. Possible values: a branch name, e.g., ``main``, or a commit hash.

To run the container:

.. code:: text

    docker run \
        --name strictdoc \
        --rm \
        -e HOST_UID=$(id -u) \
        -e HOST_GID=$(id -g) \

        /bin/bash -c "strictdoc export --formats=html"

.. list-table:: ``docker run`` options breakdown
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Option**
     - **Description**

   * - ``--rm``
     - Remove container when it is exited.

   * - ``HOST_UID`` and ``HOST_GID``
     - These environment variables are used to tell the container that it should create a ``strictdoc`` user that has these values. This enables the content generated by the container to be visible outside the container under the permissions of the host user.

   * - ``-v "<folder on host>:/data"``
     - Normally the folder on the host should be the folder with the StrictDoc documentation. The ``/data`` folder must always be specified without change because that's where the Docker container is designed to operate.

   * - ``/bin/bash -c "..."``
     - This command shall typically be ``strictdoc export`` but it can also be skipped in which case the ``docker run`` will enter the container with SSH.

If entering the container manually, the ``strictdoc`` command can be run as follows:

.. code:: text

    bash-5.1# strictdoc export .
    bash-5.1# exit

The documentation shall be generated to ``./output/html`` which is accessible both on the host and inside the container.

TITLE: Security considerations

[TEXT]

STATEMENT: >>>
.. warning::
    **TL;DR**: StrictDoc's web server is not yet hardened against unsafe use. Making StrictDoc safe for deployment in public networks is an ongoing effort.

    Using StrictDoc's command-line and web interfaces should be more secure if the web server is not deployed on a public network.

Due to current constraints (refer to [LINK: SDOC_UG_LIMIT_WEB]), StrictDoc requires running a server through a command line interface in one window or OS process, and separately committing changes to documents using Git in another window or OS process. Deploying StrictDoc as a shared web server is impractical, as it still requires manual commits to SDoc files via the server's command line using Git. The future development plan for StrictDoc aims to enable its use as a standalone server application, which includes resolving the following security-related issues.

What makes StrictDoc's web server unsafe:

- The web interface is not fully hardened against unsafe inputs, such as malformed strings or files. The web server does not perform comprehensive sanity checks on the size and validity of inputs across all its HTTP endpoints.
- StrictDoc uses the `pickle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ module to cache SDoc files, significantly improving performance. However, the pickle module is not secure. The pickled files are currently stored in the /tmp folder, which poses risks under certain circumstances.
- The security-related properties of the textX/Arpeggio parser are not understood yet. We have opened a request to track this upstream: `textX -  Security considerations (#422) <https://github.com/textX/textX/discussions/422>`_.
- Several uses of regular expressions may be unsafe, some of which have been identified by GitHub's CodeQL analyzer.
- The security aspects of StrictDoc's dependencies have not yet been analyzed.

Known security-related issues are tracked on GitHub, under the `"Security" label <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+security+label%3ASecurity>`_. As StrictDoc becomes usable without command-line access, all known issues will need to be addressed or acknowledged as known limitations.

We are committed to continuously enhancing the functionality and security of StrictDoc and welcome user feedback and contributions in this area.

[TEXT]
MID: aad57726976f4882982458de90d168c7
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc language markup (SDoc) can be activated in all IDEs that support the
TextMate grammars. When the StrictDoc grammar is integrated into an IDE, the
SDoc syntax becomes highlighted just as any other syntax like Markdown, RST,
Python, etc.

The TextMate grammars can be defined in either JSON or PLIST formats.
The `Sublime Text's Syntax <https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html>`_ is
similar to the TextMate grammar but has more capabilities and is no longer
backward-compatible with both TextMate's JSON and PLIST grammars.

The following IDEs are known to work:

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code (TextMate JSON)
- JetBrains's PyCharm and WebStorm (TextMate JSON). The other `JetBrains IDEs <https://www.jetbrains.com/products/>`_ are expected to work too.
- Eclipse (TextMate JSON)
- Sublime Text (Sublime Syntax)
- Neovim (Tree-sitter grammar)

Due to the incompatibilities between these formats, the markup files are provided in separate repositories:

- `strictdoc-project/strictdoc.tmLanguage <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc.tmLanguage>`_ – TextMate grammar files for StrictDoc (JSON).
- `strictdoc-project/strictdoc.tmbundle <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc.tmbundle>`_ – TextMate grammar files for StrictDoc (PLIST).
- `strictdoc-project/strictdoc.sublime-syntax <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc.sublime-syntax>`_ –  StrictDoc markup syntax highlighting in Sublime Text.
- `manueldiagostino/tree-sitter-strictdoc <https://github.com/manueldiagostino/tree-sitter-strictdoc>`_ – StrictDoc Tree‑sitter parser for Neovim.

The instructions for installing the StrictDoc markup can be found in all repositories.

For any other IDE, when possible, it is recommended to use the TextMate JSON
format, unless a given IDE is known to only support the TextMate bundle format
(``.tmbundle``). The exception is Sublime Text which has its own format.

.. note::

    The TextMate grammar and the Sublime Syntax for StrictDoc only provides syntax highlighting.
    More advanced features like autocompletion and deep validation of requirements can be only achieved with a dedicated Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for StrictDoc.
    The StrictDoc LSP is on StrictDoc's long-term roadmap, see
    `Enhancement: Language Protocol Server for SDoc text language #577
    <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/issues/577>`_.

A composite node is similar to a regular leaf node, but it can also nest other nodes.

This element can be useful in lower-level specification documents where a given section must describe a single feature, and the description requires one or more levels of nesting. In such cases, it may be natural to use a composite node that is tightly connected to several related sub-nodes.

The ``[[SECTION]]`` element is a reserved composite node in StrictDoc's default grammar, used to represent nested document sections or chapters. Users can also define custom composite nodes by registering them in the document grammar as follows:

StrictDoc supports the automatic generation of machine identifiers (MIDs). This optional feature can be enabled individually for each document through the document-level ``ENABLE_MID`` config option. If the MIDs are enabled, the document must also provide an explicit grammar for its nodes (see [LINK: SECTION-UG-DOCUMENT-GRAMMAR]) because the default grammar does not include the MID identifier for its default TEXT and REQUIREMENT elements. All grammar elements must include the MID field.

When the ``ENABLE_MID`` option is enabled, StrictDoc automatically generates MID fields whenever the document is written back to the file system.

With the web server, MIDs are generated automatically when a document, section, or requirement is saved.

With the command-line interface, the generation of ``MID`` can be initiated with a ``export`` command. Executing ``strictdoc export --formats sdoc`` on a document with ``ENABLE_MID: True`` results in all nodes having auto-generated MIDs.

.. note::

    StrictDoc provides the ENABLE_MID option on a per-document basis because this allows for the integration of MID-enabled documents alongside third-party documents where the MID feature may not be necessary or possible.

TITLE: Unique vs machine identifiers (MID vs UID)

[TEXT]
MID: a5a3d62d90f646aa8fac43795aa8fcbb
STATEMENT: >>>
Machine identifiers (MIDs) differ from and do not replace unique identifiers (UIDs). A requirement, section, or document node may have both ``MID`` and ``UID`` fields defined. For example:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [REQUIREMENT]
    MID: 06ab121d3c0f4d8c94652323b8f735c6

    TITLE: Move nodes between documents
    STATEMENT: >>>
    The Requirements Tool shall allow moving nodes (sections, requirements) between documents.
    <<<

Advantages of using machine identifiers:

1. Machine identifiers provide a robust means of identifying documents, sections, requirements, or custom nodes. An MID can uniquely identify a given node, independent of other fields like UID or TITLE.

2. MIDs increase the portability of requirements data. Even when UID naming conventions change or nodes are relocated, the MID continues to uniquely identify the original node.

3. The unique identification of nodes via MIDs allows precise tracking of changes using StrictDoc's Diff/Changelog functionality. It allows the algorithm to accurately match requirements, sections, or document nodes, even if they are moved, renamed, or undergo metadata changes.

For larger projects, particularly those with extended maintenance cycles, we strongly recommend activating machine identifiers early in the project lifecycle. This proactive approach ensures robust tracking and management of documentation throughout the project's duration.

    Some documents do not use unique identifiers which makes it impossible to trace their requirements to each other.

StrictDoc does not impose any limitations on the format of a UID. Examples of
typical conventions for naming UIDs:

- ``REQ-001``, ``SCA-001`` (scalability), ``PERF-001`` (performance), etc.
- ``cES1008``, ``cTBL6000.1`` (example from NASA cFS requirements)

The ``RELATIONS`` must be the last field of a requirement. For ``TYPE: Parent`` and ``TYPE: Child`` relations, the ``VALUE`` attribute contains a parent/child's requirement
``UID``. A requirement may reference multiple parent or child requirements by
adding multiple ``TYPE``/``VALUE`` items. Defining circular
references e.g. ``Req-A`` ⇒ ``Req-B`` ⇒ ``Reg-C`` ⇒ ``Req-A`` results in validation errors and must be avoided.

The ``TYPE: File``-``VALUE`` attribute contains a filename referencing the
implementation of (parts of) this requirement. A requirement may add multiple
file references requirements by adding multiple ``TYPE: File``-``VALUE`` items.

    The ``TYPE: Parent`` and ``TYPE: Child`` are currently the only fully supported types of connection.
    Linking requirements to files is still experimental (see also [LINK: SECTION-TRACEABILITY-REQS-TO-SOURCE-CODE]).

.. note::

    In most requirements projects, only the Parent relations should be used, possibly with roles.
    The Child relation should be used only in specific cases.
    See [LINK: SDOC_UG_GRAMMAR_RELATIONS_PARENT_VS_CHILD] for more details.

.. note::

    In the near future, adding information about external references (e.g. company policy documents, technical specifications, regulatory requirements, etc.) is planned.

.. note::

    By design, StrictDoc will only show parent or child links if both requirements connected with a reference have ``UID`` defined.

For each node field, StrictDoc supports both single-line and multiline fields.

Example:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [NODE]
    TITLE: Single-line field
    STATEMENT: >>>
    Multiline field.
    <<<

The following summarizes the current StrictDoc convention for using single-line vs. multiline fields:

In the default and most common use case, single-line fields are used for meta-information such as ``MID``, ``UID``, ``TITLE``, ``TAGS``, etc. Multiline fields are used for the actual document or requirement content such as ``STATEMENT``, ``RATIONALE``, ``COMMENT``, and similar fields.

Single-line fields are parsed as plain text, not as RST. To render RST or to have ``[LINK: ...]`` recognized as HTML, the field must be multiline.

By convention, each node contains one primary multiline ``STATEMENT`` field (or an equivalent). All fields before this main statement field should be single-line fields storing meta-information, and all fields after the statement field should typically be multiline content.

There is an ongoing discussion on GitHub about formalizing the single-line and multiline convention in the SDoc format: https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/discussions/2221. User feedback is welcome.

.. note::
    The composable documents is an early feature with only 50%+ of the implementation complete. See `Epic: UI: Composable documents <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/issues/1698>`_.

StrictDoc ``.sdoc`` files can be built-up from including other documents where a document can be included to no more than one including document.

The ``[DOCUMENT_FROM_FILE]`` element can be used anywhere body elements can be
used (e.g. ``[SECTION]``, ``[REQUIREMENT]``, ``[TEXT]`` etc.) and will
evaluate by inserting its contents from the file referenced by its ``FILE:`` property
where it was used in the parent document. The files included must be proper SDoc
documents and have a usual ``.sdoc`` extension.

Here is an example pair of files similar to examples above. First the
``.sdoc`` file has a ``[DOCUMENT_FROM_FILE]`` that references the latter file.

.. code:: strictdoc

    [DOCUMENT]
    TITLE: StrictDoc

    [DOCUMENT_FROM_FILE]
    FILE: include.sdoc

    [TEXT]
    STATEMENT: >>>
    This text is in the main document.
    <<<

Then the referenced file, ``include.sdoc``:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [DOCUMENT]
    TITLE: Section ABC

    [TEXT]
    STATEMENT: >>>
    This text is in the included document.
    <<<

Which will resolve to the following document after inclusion:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [DOCUMENT]
    TITLE: StrictDoc

    [[SECTION]]
    TITLE: Section ABC

    [TEXT]
    STATEMENT: >>>
    This text is in the included document.

.. admonition:: Observation

    Different industries have their own types of requirements documents with specialized meta information.
    Examples:
    ``ASIL`` in the automotive industry or ``HERITAGE`` field in some of the requirements documents by NASA.

    For anything beyond a small project, it's best to define a document grammar early. The default implicit document grammar works for quick tests, but real projects often need extra fields or custom node types. Starting with your own grammar saves time later. The instructions for defining a document grammar follow below.

StrictDoc allows declaration of document grammars with custom fields that are
specific to a particular document.

First, such fields have to be registered on a document level using the
``[GRAMMAR]`` field. The following example defines a grammar with three elements: ``SECTION``, ``TEXT``, and ``REQUIREMENT``, where the REQUIREMENT element includes several custom fields, such as the ``VERIFICATION`` field.

.. code:: strictdoc

    [DOCUMENT]
    TITLE: How to declare a document grammar

    [GRAMMAR]
    ELEMENTS:
    - TAG: SECTION
      PROPERTIES:
        IS_COMPOSITE: True
        PREFIX: None
        VIEW_STYLE: Narrative
      FIELDS:
      - TITLE: MID
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False

    - TAG: TEXT
      FIELDS:
      - TITLE: UID
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False
      - TITLE: STATEMENT
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True

        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True
      - TITLE: COMMENT
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True

This declaration configures the parser to recognize the declared fields as
defined by a user. Declaring a special field as ``REQUIRED: True`` makes this
field mandatory for each and every requirement in the document.

When the fields are registered on the document level, it becomes possible to
declare them as the ``[REQUIREMENT]`` special fields:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [REQUIREMENT]
    UID: ABC-123
    VERIFICATION: Test
    STATEMENT: System A shall do B.
    COMMENT: Test comment.

Each grammar element must have exactly one content field named ``STATEMENT``,
``DESCRIPTION`` or ``CONTENT``. The content field plays a key role in the HTML
user interface as well as other export formats.

All fields before the content field are considered meta information. Meta information
fields are assumed to be single-line. The content field and all following fields
accept single-line and multiline strings. See [LINK: SECTION-UG-Single-vs-multiline-fields] for more details.

.. note::

    The order of fields in each document node must match the order of their declaration in the grammar.

The supported field types are:

   * - **Field type**
     - **Description**

   * - ``String``
     - Simple String

   * - ``SingleChoice``
     - Enum-like behavior, one choice is possible. Must be single-line and thus
       has to be defined before the content field.

   * - ``MultipleChoice``
     - comma-separated words with fixed options. Must be single-line and thus has
       to be defined before the content field.

   * - ``Tag``
     - comma-separated list of tags/key words. Only Alphanumeric tags (a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and underscore) are supported.

.. note::

    The **field type** also influences how the field is presented in the web editor UI. A ``SingleChoice`` field enables an auto-completion function, which is useful in cases where the same values are entered repeatedly (such as requirement owners, test case types, or status fields).

STATEMENT: >>>
**TL;DR** If there is no compelling reason to use the Child relations, avoid using them.

Most of the technical requirements documents can be modeled with just a Parent relation type. A typical traceability graph for a requirements project is typically child-to-parent, where the higher-level parent requirements are referred to as "Parents" by their child requirements.

For example, in one (parent) document:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [REQUIREMENT]
    UID: PARENT-1
    TITLE: Parent requirement
    STATEMENT: >>>
    ...
    <<<

Somewhere in another child document:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [REQUIREMENT]
    UID: CHILD-1
    TITLE: Child requirement
    STATEMENT: >>>
    ...
    <<<
    RELATIONS:
    - TYPE: Parent
      VALUE: PARENT-001

In some very special cases, it may be desired to also use the Child relations. For example, creating a so-called Compliance Matrix between a standard and a project requirement can use the Child relation to connect both the upper-level standard requirement with a project-level technical requirement:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [DOCUMENT]
    TITLE: Standard X Compliance Matrix

    [GRAMMAR]
    ELEMENTS:
    - TAG: REQUIREMENT
      FIELDS:
      - TITLE: COMPLIANCE
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True
      - TITLE: TITLE
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True
      - TITLE: STATEMENT
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True
      RELATIONS:
      - TYPE: Parent
      - TYPE: Child

    [REQUIREMENT]
    COMPLIANCE: Compliant.
    TITLE: STANDARD-001
    STATEMENT: >>>
    This is a compliance statement regarding the Standard X's STANDARD-001 requirement...
    <<<
    RELATIONS:
    - TYPE: Parent
      VALUE: STANDARD-001
    - TYPE: Child
      VALUE: PROJECT-001

With such a setup, StrictDoc generates the correct traceability graph that will link together the requirements of the PROJECT with the requirements of the STANDARD through the requirements of the compliance matrix.

Another example can be adapting the requirements of the Off-the-Shelf (OTS) project to the higher-level requirements of the user project. An intermediate requirements document can be created that connects the parent requirements of the user project with the immutable child requirements of the OTS project. This intermediate document can link the user requirement with the Parent and the OTS project with a Child link.

Both examples above involve an activity called "tailoring" in which an
intermediate document (the Compliance Matrix) serves as an interface between two
layers of documents. Tailoring means that a user may implement only a subset of
a standard and explicitly specify which requirements are implemented, which are
not, and where deviations from the standard occur.

[TEXT]
MID: 4398b17f61ad4dd290e72d7888597f48
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc allows connecting requirements to source code files in two ways:

1. Linking source files to requirements by adding special markers in the source code without modifying the requirements.
2. Linking requirements to source files by adding relations in the requirements without altering the source code.

The advantage of the first approach is that requirements remain agnostic to the source code and implementation details. Special markers are added solely to the source files, creating traceability back to the requirements.

The benefit of the second approach is that traceability to source files is established without any modification to the source code. This can be useful in projects where adding markers to the source code is undesirable or not feasible.

Both options can be used independently or in combination, depending on the project setup and allocation of software components.

To activate the traceability to source files, configure the project config with a dedicated feature:

.. code:: toml

    [project]

    features = [
      "REQUIREMENT_TO_SOURCE_TRACEABILITY"
    ]

By default, StrictDoc looks for source files in a directory from which the ``strictdoc`` command is run. This can be changed by using the ``source_root_path`` project-level option.

See [LINK: SDOC_UG_OPTIONS_PROJECT_LEVEL] for more details about the project-level options.

`strictdoc-examples <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc-examples>`_

MID: 07bfe045a4934dd29d97fdb8ac567b7c
STATEMENT: >>>
For parsing source code and calculating traceability to requirements, StrictDoc uses a general parser that is agnostic of specific programming languages and their constructs, such as classes or functions. However, for languages with these constructs, establishing traceability to them can simplify the tracing process.

As an experimental option, StrictDoc supports parsing source files of selected programming languages to recognize language syntax, primarily enabling traceability of functions (in Python, C, and others), classes (in Python, C++, and others) and tests (Python, C++, Robot Framework) to requirements.

To activate language-aware traceability, configure the project with the following features:

.. code:: toml

    features = [
      "REQUIREMENT_TO_SOURCE_TRACEABILITY",

MID: c787c538cc0a422fb2898b525ec1006d
STATEMENT: >>>
To connect a source file to a requirement, a dedicated ``@relation`` marker must be added to the source file. Several marker types are supported, depending on the programming language. For example, the ``scope=class`` option is available for Python files but not for C files, as C does not support classes. The marker supports both () and {} for arguments.

.. note::

    For language-specific parsing of source code, e.g., Python and C, make sure to enable the corresponding option, see [LINK: SECTION-UG-Language-aware-parsing-of-source-code].

It is also possible to use @relation markers and be compatible with Doxygen. See [LINK: SECTION-UG-Doxygen].

**1\) Linking a file to a requirement**

The marker must be added to the top comment of a file.

.. code:: python

    """
    This file implements ...

    @relation(REQ-1, scope=file)
    """

**2\) Linking a class to a requirement (Python only)**

.. code:: python

    class Foo:
        """
        This class implements ...

        @relation(REQ-1, scope=class)
        """

**3\) Linking a function to a requirement (Python, C, and C++ only)**

.. code:: python

    class Foo:
        def bar(self):
            """
            This function implements ...

            @relation(REQ-1, scope=function)

    void hello_world(void) {
        print("Hello, World\n");
    }

.. note::

    For the C and C++ languages, if a ``@relation`` marker is included in a function declaration prototype (which is the most common practice), StrictDoc also creates a link between the requirement and the corresponding C function definition.

**4\) Linking a range to a requirement**

.. code:: python

    def foo():
        # @relation(REQ-1, scope=range_start)
        print("Hello, World!")
        # @relation(REQ-1, scope=range_end)

To enable SDoc node parsing, the corresponding source file must be registered in the ``strictdoc.toml`` configuration as follows:

.. code:: toml

    features = [
      "REQUIREMENT_TO_SOURCE_TRACEABILITY",
      "SOURCE_FILE_LANGUAGE_PARSERS",
    ]

    # if custom include_source_paths are set, it must include the corresponding source file
    include_source_paths = ["tests/**"]

    source_nodes = [
        { "tests/" = { uid = "TEST_DOC", node_type = "TEST_SPEC" } }
    ]

With the above declaration, StrictDoc will locate the document with the specified UID and automatically populate it with parsed descriptions. This allows the user to start with a basic template of their choice, knowing that it will be filled with content extracted from the source files.

STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc has an initial support of exporting to and importing from the ReqIF
format.

.. note::

    It is not possible to implement a single export/import procedure that works well for all ReqIF XML files produced by various requirements management tools.
    The export/import workflow is therefore tool-specific.
    See [LINK: SECTION-REQIF-DETAILS] for more details.

Supported formats:

- StrictDoc's "native" export/import between SDoc and ReqIF

Planned formats:

- The format recommended by the
  `ReqIF Implementation Guide <https://www.ps-ent-2023.de/fileadmin/prod-download/PSI_ImplementationGuide_ReqIF_V1-7.pdf>`_
  that attempts to harmonize the developments of ReqIF by requirements
  management tools.

STATEMENT: >>>
The following options are available for ReqIF export/import commands.

``--reqif-multiline-is-xhtml`` This option makes StrictDoc to export all multiline fields as XHTML attributes, not as STRING (the default behavior). This is useful for interfacing with tools, such as Polarion, which assume XHTML as the primary format for writing multiline text.

``--reqif-import-markup={RST,HTML,Text}`` This option makes StrictDoc import ReqIF to SDoc documents, setting their ``MARKUP`` option to the markup value provided. The default value is RST which is the default markup of StrictDoc. When working with other ReqIF tools, very often this option can be set to HTML. It is likely that with this option, the previous option ``--reqif-multiline-is-xhtml`` should be enabled as well.

``--reqif-enable-mid`` This option requires the machine identifiers option to be enabled (see [LINK: SECTION-UG-Machine-identifiers-MID]) and allows all nodes machine identifiers (MID) exported as ReqIF IDENTIFIERs. This option can be useful when the MID/IDENTIFIER stability of document, section, and requirement nodes is critical when doing iterative export/import roundtrips.

All options can be also specified in a project's TOML file as follows:

.. code:: toml

    [project]

    [reqif]
    multiline_is_xhtml = true
    import_markup = "HTML"

STATEMENT: >>>
The ReqIF is a `standard <https://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF>`_ which is
maintained by Object Management Group (OMG). One important feature of the
ReqIF standard is that it requires a fixed XML structure but still leaves
certain details open to the implementation by the ReqIF and requirements
management tools developers. Specifically, each tool may use it own field
names and structure to represent requirements and sections/chapters.

In order to accommodate for the differences between ReqIF files produced by
various tools, the ReqIF processing is split into two layers:

1) Parsing ReqIF from ``.reqif`` XML files into ReqIF in-memory tree of Python
objects as well as unparsing the ReqIF in-memory tree back to ReqIF XML files is
extracted to a separate library:
`strictdoc-project/reqif <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/reqif>`_.

2) Converting between in-memory trees of SDoc and ReqIF. This layer is part of
StrictDoc.

For further overview of the ReqIF format and the ``reqif`` library's
implementation details, refer to
`strictdoc-project/reqif <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/reqif>`_'s
documentation.

[TEXT]
MID: 4504bffd6ced4aa78848ee9e03fdd4b7
STATEMENT: >>>
At present, StrictDoc lacks a documented public Python API. Nevertheless, users can leverage StrictDoc's internal API to enhance existing functions or create custom import, export, and analysis tools. The architecture of StrictDoc is highly modular, so for each functional block there shall always be a dedicated Python class with a public interface, see [LINK: SECTION-DD-High-level-architecture].

One good example is the ``SDWriter`` class, which exercises the complete export of the Python data objects to the SDoc format. Since, the SDoc format is the primary data format of StrictDoc, the SDWriter is quite feature-rich in what it does and covers. The ``RSTWriter`` is less powerful because it does not reflect the full data model, but is probably worth a look as well.

The ``strictdoc/backend/reqif`` folder contains exporter/importer routines for the ReqIF format. There, the core classes from the Python data model, e.g. SDocNode, Section, Document, Grammar, etc. are created or read from and to the ReqIF format.

The ``ManageAutoUIDCommand`` class features a good use of all APIs that one may need to read/update/write back a SDoc document tree:

- The ``TraceabilityIndex`` is created from a project config. The traceability index is the main class for storing the whole traceability graph in Python objects. It has plenty of methods for reading and writing things from the graph.
- The ``DocumentUIDAnalyzer`` is an example of how the objects are manipulated in memory.
- And finally the final sequence writes the mutated traceability graph back to files using ``SDWriter``.

For any custom Python API request, for example, a need to do a more advanced data analysis on SDoc data, open a GitHub issue and your specific issue will be handled.

[TEXT]
MID: e15260727be84ce394386a4f95c627ae
STATEMENT: >>>
.. note::

    **TL;DR**: The following topic of portability becomes relevant if documentation created with StrictDoc has to be exported to another tool and especially if the other tool has to export the content back to StrictDoc. Writing custom export/import generators may be needed to enable a full interoperability when the less portable features are used.

The portability of documentation, particularly when it involves requirements, shares similarities to the portability of programming languages. StrictDoc has several features that are useful but they can also limit the interoperability of the documentation/requirements when the content is exchanged with other tools.

The following is a list of features that are considered less portable when it comes to interfacing with other tools through the existing export/import interfaces:

- [LINK: UG_COMPOSABLE_DOCUMENTS]. Composing documents from other documents is a useful feature but it may not be directly supported by other tools. When exporting to JSON or ReqIF, StrictDoc by default does not export included documents but only the including documents.
- [LINK: UG_COMPOSITE_NODE]. A Composite Requirement is a useful concept which is natively supported by StrictDoc but it may be supported less by other tools.
- [LINK: UG_NODE_WITHOUT_A_LEVEL]. Table of contents hierarchy where some nodes do not have TOC levels (or have custom TOC levels) can cause problems when exporting/importing documentation content if an interfacing tool does not support custom TOC nodes.

.. note::

    It is easier to extend StrictDoc to produce a format supported by a given tool than it is to make the other tool export a 100%-identical content back to StrictDoc. If there is a need to interface with a tool X and something is missing in StrictDoc, please reach out to the developers (see [LINK: SDOC_UG_CONTACT]).

HTML documentation generated by StrictDoc can be integrated with Doxygen documentation.

Doxygen includes a ``TAGFILE`` feature that allows linking to external documentation. This tagfile is in XML format and looks like this:

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes' ?>
    <tagfile doxygen_version="1.9.8">
      <compound kind="file">

        <filename>strictdocfolder/mystrictdocreq.html#REQ-1</filename>
      </compound>
    </tagfile>

StrictDoc automatically generates a Doxygen tagfile containing the requirements using the export command:

.. code:: text

    strictdoc export . --formats=html,doxygen

When a requirement is referenced in a source code comment block with the command ``\ref REQ-1``, Doxygen includes a link to the corresponding ``<filename/>`` in the output.

The location of the StrictDoc export can be specified in the TAGFILE field, either as a relative path, e.g., ``TAGFILES = strictdoc.tag=../../strictdoc``, or as an absolute URL, e.g., ``TAGFILES = strictdoc.tag=http://example.com/strictdoc``.

To make the StrictDoc @relation keyword work with Doxygen, an alias has to be created:

.. code:: text

    ALIASES  += relation{2}="\ref \1"

resulting in the following syntax to be recognized by Doxygen: ``@relation{REQ-1, scope=function}``.

StrictDoc supports search and filtering of document content. However, this feature has not been extensively tested and is hidden behind a feature flag. To activate it, enable the corresponding setting in the ``strictdoc.toml`` configuration file:

.. code:: toml

    [project]

    features = [

STATEMENT: >>>
The ``export`` command-line interface command supports filtering documentation content with the ``--filter-nodes`` option.

The option is based on the Query Engine, so the same rules that are valid for Search also apply for filtering. When a filter is applied, only the whitelisted nodes will be exported.

This feature is not enabled by default because it has not undergone sufficient testing by users. The particular aspect requiring extensive testing is related to StrictDoc's interaction with Git to retrieve git commit information. There remain certain unexamined edge cases and portability concerns, e.g., testing on Windows, testing projects that have no Git version control, calling StrictDoc outside of a project's root folder.

[TEXT]
MID: 7cf15de69efc46a5abe6b6fc786e4b71
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc allows users to write their own custom statistics generators.

To connect a custom generator, add it to the ``strictdoc.toml`` configuration file as follows:

.. code:: toml

    [project]
    title = "StrictDoc Documentation"

    statistics_generator = "custom_statistics.CustomStatisticsGenerator"

The path specified by the config variable must be a valid path to a Python file, and the last component must reference an existing statistics generator class. StrictDoc automatically adds the document input path to its Python search paths, so the specified path must be discoverable relative to the location where the SDoc documents are read.

A statistics generator is a class that iterates over the traceability index, collects and calculates relevant statistics about the traceability graph, and stores the results as a list of ``Metric`` and ``MetricSection`` objects.

.. note::

    StrictDoc’s built-in statistics generator is a good example of how to implement a custom one. See `SDocStatisticsGenerator <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/blob/6f57747e6a1b5b3cb29c0047f9df5959da64ebb1/docs/sdoc_project_statistics.py>`_.

- How to allow users to customize rules for color-coding the document nodes.
- How should the traceability mechanics work when there are multiple levels of requirements and a given requirement can reference either source files or child requirements.

STATEMENT: >>>
The "Git Diff/Changelog" experimental feature in StrictDoc allows users to track changes between different versions of requirement documents. This feature provides a visual diff by highlighting what content has been added, removed, or modified within the SDoc files, using a style similar to Git diffs. It helps in maintaining version history, ensuring that changes are traceable, and supports auditing by showing how requirements evolve over time.

To activate the Diff/Changelog screen, add/edit the strictdoc.toml config file in the root of your repository with documentation content.

.. code:: toml

    [project]
    title = "My project"

    features = [
      "DIFF"
    ]

With the feature enabled, the editable web server interface displays the corresponding Diff/Changelog screen, where users can select Git revisions to compare for change tracking.

To use the feature with a command-line interface:

.. code:: text

    strictdoc export . --generate-diff-git="HEAD^..HEAD"

.. admonition:: Robust MID-based change tracking
    :class: note

    For optimal results when using the Diff/Changelog feature in a StrictDoc-based project, it is strongly recommended to enable Machine Identifiers (MIDs) for all project artifacts, such as TEXT, REQUIREMENT, and others. Without MIDs, StrictDoc relies on change tracking based on node UIDs, which is less reliable due to at least the following two issues:

    1. The need to maintain UIDs for sections and text nodes, not only for requirements.
    2. Possible changes to node UIDs. If a node UID changes, for example due to a change in project conventions, StrictDoc cannot reliably determine whether the node has been modified or relocated in later versions of the documentation tree.

TITLE: HTML2PDF document generator

[TEXT]
MID: 6e610b9a381f4b5d9d26004dd286e001
STATEMENT: >>>
StrictDoc offers an experimental feature for converting HTML documents into PDF files. This feature aims to deliver a good PDF printing experience without the necessity of installing more sophisticated printing systems like LaTeX.

There are three methods of PDF printing available:

1. Through the command-line interface with the ``strictdoc export --formats=html2pdf ...`` command.

2. Within the web interface by clicking the 'Export to PDF' button.

3. Also in the web interface, by navigating to a 'PDF' view of a document and using the browser's built-in Print function.

The first two methods require the Chrome browser and chromedriver to be installed on the user's computer.
StrictDoc downloads chromedriver on demand by default, or uses a pre installed executable if
``strictdoc export --chromedriver=/path/to/chromedriver`` or the equivalent ``strictdoc.toml`` option is given.

When printing from the command line (the first method), you can use the ``--generate-bundle-document`` option to have StrictDoc generate a single PDF document that bundles together all individual PDFs. The bundle document gets the document version/date information from Git by default which can be controlled in the ``strictdoc.toml`` config (the default values are shown):

.. code:: text

    bundle_document_version = "@GIT_VERSION (Git branch: @GIT_BRANCH)"
    bundle_document_date = "@GIT_COMMIT_DATETIME"

To disable bundle document version/date automatic generation, set ``bundle_document_version``/``bundle_document_date`` to empty strings or use any custom values.

The third method, the PDF screen, presents a version of the document that is optimized for browser printing. This approach allows for the creation of neatly formatted PDF documents or directly printed documents. Although this method is compatible with any browser, Chrome is recommended for the best printing results. Unlike Firefox and Safari, Chrome maintains the document's internal hyperlinks in the printed PDF.

To activate the HTML2PDF screen in the web interface, add/edit the ``strictdoc.toml`` config file in the root of your repository with documentation content.

.. code:: toml

    [project]
    title = "My project"

    features = [
      "HTML2PDF"
    ]

This feature is not enabled by default because the implementation has not been completed yet. The underlying JavaScript library is being improved with respect to how the SDoc HTML content is split between pages, in particular the splitting of HTML ``<table>`` tags is being worked out.

[TEXT]
MID: 202f6fffba9f4000a95cd69933839fc3
STATEMENT: >>>
The ``html2pdf_forced_page_break_nodes`` allows specifying which nodes should always start on a new page when printed to PDF using the HTML2PDF feature. It is especially useful for documents that contain very large, descriptive requirement nodes with a lot of text. In such cases, starting each node on a new page helps avoid having the beginning of a node lost in the middle of a page.

Example of ``strictdoc_config.py``:

.. code-block:: py

    from strictdoc.core.project_config import ProjectConfig


    def create_config() -> ProjectConfig:
        config = ProjectConfig(

The existing implementation of the web user interface is alpha-quality and incomplete. The user interface and the underlying backend implementation are not yet autonomous from the command-line workflow.

The currently supported workflow for the ``server`` command must be hybrid:

- In one terminal window: run server.
- In another window: check the changes made by the server in the .sdoc files. Commit the .sdoc files to Git.

Note that currently, StrictDoc server maintains an in-memory state of a documentation tree, and it does not watch over the changes made in the .sdoc files. If you make a change in an ``.sdoc`` file manually, you have to restart the server in order for your changes to show up in the web user interface.

The following essential features are still missing and will be worked on in the future:

- Adding images to the multiline fields like such requirements and text nodes ``STATEMENT``.
- Adding/editing sections with ``LEVEL: None``.
- Deleting a document.
- Deleting a section recursively with a correct cleanup of all traceability information.
- A separate screen for editing project settings.
- Editing File-based relations.

TITLE: FREETEXT-TEXT migration (June 2024)

[TEXT]
MID: 2509cce7ee634c7a8878c5e1094b83f2
STATEMENT: >>>
A new grammar node called ``TEXT`` has been introduced in the SDoc grammar, replacing the ``FREETEXT`` node as a more powerful feature.

The reasons for the migration:

- The ``[FREETEXT]..[/FREETEXT]`` markup element is limited. Unlike ``REQUIREMENT`` it is not possible to attach fields like MID or UID, which can be important for change tracking and importing/exporting from formats like ReqIF and SPDX, which assign unique identifiers to all nodes of the document / requirements graph, not just the requirements nodes.
- Historically, the ``[FREETEXT]`` node was implemented differently compared to the ``REQUIREMENT`` node, creating a lot of branching and requiring two separate sets of code to handle free text and requirements slightly differently.
- 15000 lines of code are removed, eliminating numerous branches, such as ``if node.is_requirement ... elif node.is_free_text``.

.. image:: _assets/StrictDoc_Workspace-FREETEXT-TEXT.drawio.png
   :alt: The FREE-TEXT migration
   :class: image
   :width: 100%

There are three important consequences of this migration.

**Consequence #1:** The ``TEXT`` nodes can now have ``UID`` (if declared in a grammar) and ``MID`` (if the ``ENABLE_MID: True`` option is enabled), but the automatic generation of UIDs is disabled for ``TEXT`` nodes in the first version after the migration. User feedback regarding the potential use cases for ``TEXT`` node's UID/MID identifiers would be nice to have.

**Consequence #2:** Now it is possible to create a ``[LINK]`` to any custom elements, not only ``FREETEXT`` elements like it was before.

**Consequence #3**: It is now possible to place ``[TEXT]`` nodes anywhere within a document or a section. Previously, ``[FREETEXT]`` nodes could only be placed directly after the Document or Section titles. This limitation originated from the original implementation of ``FREETEXT`` but has now been removed. This should improve the experience for users whose documents contain a mix of requirements and text nodes.

**Consequence #4**: Previously, it was not possible to reference FREETEXT nodes from source files because FREETEXT lacked a UID field. Now, TEXT nodes can be referenced by a UID, just like any other REQUIREMENT-like node.

[TEXT]
MID: 5d2f033604824264b1cc05840997c6b8
STATEMENT: >>>
The backward compatibility is preserved. The users can still create SDoc documents with ``FREETEXT`` but internally the free text nodes will be anyway converted to ``TEXT`` nodes, and the FREETEXT node no longer exist in the SDoc document model.

The users are encouraged to perform the migration as follows.

The free text node:

.. code:: text

    [FREETEXT]
    This is a free text node.
    [/FREETEXT]

becomes

.. code:: strictdoc

    [TEXT]
    STATEMENT: >>>
    This is a free text node.
    <<<

The ``TEXT`` node is now included to a default StrictDoc grammar by default. If a custom grammar is used, the default grammar definition for the ``TEXT`` node is as follows:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [GRAMMAR]
    ELEMENTS:
    - TAG: TEXT
      FIELDS:
      - TITLE: UID
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False
      - TITLE: STATEMENT

        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False
      - TITLE: STATEMENT
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True

The ``strictdoc export --formats sdoc --free-text-to-text ...`` command can be used for converting all FREETEXT nodes to TEXT nodes automatically. See ``strictdoc export --help`` for more details.

1\) The ``[[CUSTOM_NODE]]`` syntax with two square brackets around the element name has been introduced for composite nodes.

Example of declaring a composite node in a grammar and using it in a document:

.. code:: strictdoc

    [GRAMMAR]
    ELEMENTS:
    - TAG: SECTION
      PROPERTIES:
        IS_COMPOSITE: True
        PREFIX: None
        VIEW_STYLE: Narrative
      FIELDS:
      - TITLE: MID
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False
      - TITLE: UID
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: False
      - TITLE: TITLE
        TYPE: String
        REQUIRED: True

    [[SECTION]]
    TITLE: Section #1

    [[/SECTION]]

Using the new syntax, it is now possible to declare any custom composite element, such as what ``[COMPOSITE_REQUIREMENT]`` used to provide before.

2\) The previously used ``[SECTION]`` syntax with one square bracket around the SECTION is now DEPRECATED, but the old behavior is still supported. The users are encouraged to migrate all ``[SECTION]`` elements to the new ``[[SECTION]]`` syntax. To support the new behavior, the grammar must include a declaration for a composite SECTION element similar to the example provided above.

3\) The ``[COMPOSITE_REQUIREMENT]`` node has been removed from the codebase. This is a backward-incompatible change, but it is assumed that no users should be affected since this feature has never been developed enough to be useful.

4\) The document-level ``REQ_PREFIX`` has been renamed/aliased to ``PREFIX``. The REQ_PREFIX form will still be recognized but writing SDoc files back to disk will result in the new PREFIX field to be written.

TITLE: How to migrate from [SECTION] to [[SECTION]]

STATEMENT: >>>
The migration from ``[SECTION]`` to the new composite ``[[SECTION]]`` syntax is mostly straightforward and can be done manually. However, StrictDoc also provides a dedicated configuration option to assist with this migration.

1\) **Manual approach**

Update all instances of ``[SECTION]`` to ``[[SECTION]]`` manually, or use a combination of ``find`` and ``sed``. Additionally, make sure to update all document grammar declarations to include the new composite ``[[SECTION]]`` element like described in the previous section.

.. note::

    StrictDoc can automatically create the ``[[SECTION]]`` element even if it is not explicitly defined in the document grammar. However, as of 2025 Q2, it is recommended that users always define explicit grammars with the SECTION element included.

Examples of a sed command for Linux and macOS:

.. code:: text

    # Linux
    find . -type f -name '*.sdoc' -exec sed -i -e 's/^\[SECTION\]/[[SECTION]]/g' -e 's/^\[\/SECTION\]/[[\/SECTION]]/g' {} +

    # macOS
    find . -type f -name '*.sdoc' -exec sed -i '' -e 's/^\[SECTION\]/[[SECTION]]/g' -e 's/^\[\/SECTION\]/[[\/SECTION]]/g' {} +

2\) **Semi-automated approach (experimental)**

StrictDoc can automatically migrate SDoc files if the project configuration option ``section_behavior`` is set as follows:

.. code:: toml

    [project]
    section_behavior = "[[SECTION]]"

With this option enabled, StrictDoc's ``export`` command will convert all ``[SECTION]`` nodes to ``[[SECTION]]`` when writing SDoc files.

To perform the migration, run the export command:

.. code:: text

    strictdoc export . --formats=sdoc

The resulting files will have all ``[SECTION]`` nodes replaced with ``[[SECTION]]``.

Additionally, when the section behavior is specified to ``[[SECTION]]``, the UI will mark the old section node as Deprecated.

TITLE: Migrating StrictDoc Configuration: Python Replaces TOML (2025 Q4)

[TEXT]

STATEMENT: >>>
Until 2025-Q4, StrictDoc has been using TOML for its ``strictdoc.toml`` configuration file.

Since 2025-Q4, the new configuration format moving forward is Python. Once the new Python configuration syntax has been sufficiently tested, using TOML will trigger deprecation warnings. The removal of TOML support is expected to take place in 2026-Q1.

The rationale for this change is that configuring StrictDoc with a Python file provides greater flexibility for users who need to:

- Create custom generators
- Remove existing generators
- Customize requirement and document tree validations
- Customize project statistics

With a configuration file written directly in Python, it becomes much easier for users to inject their own Python code into StrictDoc’s traceability pipeline. Achieving the same with TOML would require additional layers of indirection.

Instead of using ``strictdoc.toml``, the new approach includes ``strictdoc_config.py`` with the following syntax:

.. code:: python

    from strictdoc.core.project_config import ProjectConfig


    def create_config() -> ProjectConfig:
        config = ProjectConfig(
            project_title="StrictDoc Documentation",
            dir_for_sdoc_assets="assets",
            dir_for_sdoc_cache="output/_cache",
            project_features=[
                "TRACEABILITY_SCREEN",
                "SEARCH",
            ],
            # ...
        )
        return config

All TOML configuration options specified in StrictDoc’s documentation are still valid but must be migrated to their Python equivalents.

See `StrictDoc's own config file <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/blob/main/strictdoc_config.py>`_ for a realistic example.

Refer to the `ProjectConfig <https://github.com/strictdoc-project/strictdoc/blob/main/strictdoc/core/project_config.py>`_ class for a complete overview of all available options.
