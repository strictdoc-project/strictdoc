When the ``MATHJAX`` feature is enabled, we support the role for inline math.
Use like this:

    Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

When the ``MATHJAX`` feature is enabled, we support also the math directive. 
Use like this:

.. code-block ::

  .. math::

     (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

     (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Normally, equations are not numbered. If you want your equation to get a number, use 
the label option. When given, it selects a label for the equation, by which it can be 
cross-referenced, and causes an equation number to be issued. 

.. code-block ::
  
  .. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
     :label: euler
  



.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
   :label: euler

When you want to cross-reference, use this syntax:

.. code-block ::

  Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
  beautiful mathematical formulas.

There is also an option ``nowrap`` that prevents any wrapping of the given math 
in a math environment. When you give this option, you must make sure yourself 
that the math is properly set up. For example:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}
